# Mission-to-Mars
#### MODULE 10 - Webscraping


## OVERVIEW
### Purpose:  The current project was primarily an exercise in web-scraping (Splinter), parsing and understanding the scraped data (BeautifulSoup), storing the data of interest (pyMongo, MongoDB), then repurposing that data into a usefule app (Flask, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap).  The theme of this exercise was "facts and images of Mars".  Data and images scraped from the websites listed herein under 'Data Source(s)' were stored in a Mongo database, then output to our new app.  For the Challenge portion of the project, we 1) retrieved four (4) high resolution images of the Martian hemispheres, along with their respective image titles, then 2) modified our Mars app to include those images when the "Scrape New Data" button is pressed, and finally, 3) modified the app's HTML code stylistically and made sure that the app is mobile-responsive.
 
 
## RESOURCES
  - Data Source(s): https://redplanetscience.com, https://spaceimages-mars.com, https://galaxyfacts-mars.com, https://astrogeology.usgs.gov
  - Software:  Python 3.7.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Flask, pyMongo, Datetime, Webdriver_manager, html5lib, lxml, Pandas,  Visual Studio Code 1.53.2, MongoDB (NoSQL db), HTML/CSS, Bootstrap


## RESULTS
### The three part of the Challenge included:
  1. Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

  2. Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

  3. Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components


## SUMMARY
The web app is running properly and updates with the current featured Mars article each time the "Scrape New Data" button is pressed.  This was a great exercise in putting the pieces together to gather (i.e., scrape) data, transform it, and put the results together in a new web page form.  It was also a great exercise in learning to deal with compatibility issues between software components and logical troubleshooting, while also learning the various software and engineering aspects involved for each step of the process.
